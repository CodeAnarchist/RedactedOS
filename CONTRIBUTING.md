First off, thank you for taking interest in \[REDACTED] OS and in its development.

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure you read the relevant sections and follow the coding guidelines before opening a pull request.

1. Please discuss any new features ahead of time, either via email, opening an issue, or through the contact links provided.
2. Adding any new features should be justified by their use within the kernel or the system as a whole. 
3. Submit separate pull requests for different features. Code formatting, typo fixes, refactors, new features, etc. should all go into their own PRs. This will make it easier to review and accept PRs.
4. The use of AI is discouraged, and any PRs suspected to have been largely written by AI will be rejected. You should be able to understand any code you contribute.
5. Make sure to test any code that's been changed as part of your PR, and any code that might've been affected by it.
